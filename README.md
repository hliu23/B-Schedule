# B-Schedule
A website to help Brebeuf students (and students of the world) navigate the "unusual" schedules of their schools
// Description tbc, during summer

Inspired by Brebeuf Schedule 5754929, a Google Add-on created in March 2021 by the authors

With the vast majority of code written anew, B Schedule is being moved to the web platform!
This version includes new features such as customizable school day schedules, automated course selections from Google Classroom, and user profiles enabling you to edit calendars after they have been created! Of course, the entire application will still be on the web without the need for you to download anything. The application has also been redesigned to give it a fresh look!

*still in development

Ideas

// server: name changed, added scripts  
// alternate schedule that is pushed to all?
