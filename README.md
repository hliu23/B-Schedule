# [B-Schedule](https://b-schedule.herokuapp.com/about)
B Schedule, helps its users manage their class schedule by creating events in their Google Calendar that correspond to each class. First, the user selects their school from a list of supported schools, and the school's year calendar and day schedule is pulled from the database. Then, with the access the user has granted when they signed up with Google on the website, the website pulls information on each of the user's classes from their Google Classroom, which is all stored in the class section in a predetermined format. Finally, using these information, the website creates events on the user's Google Calendar which corresponds to their unique class times, and sends notifications when it is class time.
